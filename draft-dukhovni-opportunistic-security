     This memo introduces the "opportunistic security" design
     pattern.  In contrast to the established approach of employing
     protection against both passive and active attacks or else
     (frequently) no protection at all, designs based on opportunistic
     security (OS) strive to deliver at least some protection most
     of the time.  The primary goal of OS is to remove barriers to
     widespread adoption, by tailoring the minimum acceptable protection
     level to the capabilities of the peer systems.  At the very
     least, opportunistic security aims to employ unauthenticated
     encryption when authentication is not possible.  However, when
     communicating with legacy systems that do not support any form
     of encryption, opportunistic security may also employ transmission
     in cleartext.

  <section title="Introduction">

   <t>
     Historically, Internet security protocols have prioritized
     comprehensive protection against both passive and active attacks
     for peers able and motivated to absorb the associated costs.
     Since protection against active attacks relies on authentication,
     which at Internet scale is not universally available, while
     communications traffic is sometimes strongly protected, more
     typically it is not protected at all.  The fact that most
     traffic is unprotected facilitates nation-state pervasive
     monitoring (PM <xref target="RFC7258"/>) by making it
     cost-effective (or at least not cost-prohibitive).  Indiscriminate
     collection of communications traffic would be substantially
     less attractive if security protocols were designed to operate
     at a range of protection levels; with encrypted transmission
     accessible to most if not all peers, and protection against
     active attacks still employed where unconditionally required
     by policy or else discovered to be possible with a given peer.
   </t>

   <t>
     Encryption is easy, but key management is difficult.  Key
     management at Internet scale remains an incompletely solved
     problem.  The Web PKI key management
     model, which is based on broadly trusted public certification
     authorities (CAs), introduces costs that not all peers are
     willing to bear.  Web PKI public CAs are not sufficient to secure communications
     when the peer reference identity (<xref target="RFC6125"/>)
     is obtained indirectly over an insecure channel or communicating
     parties don't agree on a mutually trusted CA.  At this time,
     DNSSEC (<xref target="RFC4033"/>) is not sufficiently widely
     adopted to make DANE (<xref target="RFC6698"/>) a viable
     alternative at scale.  Trust on first use (TOFU) key management
     models (as with saved SSH fingerprints and various certificate
     pinning approaches) don't protect initial contact and require
     user intervention when key continuity fails.
   </t>

   <t>
     Without Internet-scale key management, authentication required
     for protection against active attacks is often not possible.
     When protocols only offer the options of authenticated secure
     channels or cleartext, most traffic is sent in the clear.
     Therefore, in order to make encryption more ubiquitous,
     authentication needs to be optional.  When authenticated
     communication is not possible, unauthenticated encryption is
     preferable to cleartext transmission, in that it addresses
     pervasive monitoring <xref target="RFC7258"/>.  Opportunistic
     security encourages peers to employ as much security as possible,
     without falling back on unnecessarily weak options.  In
     particular, opportunistic security encourages unauthenticated
     encryption when authentication is not an option.

   <t>
     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
     "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted
     as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
   </t>

   <t>
     The following definitions are derived from the Internet Security
     Glossary <xref target="RFC4949" />, where applicable.

     <list style="hanging">
       <t hangText="Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):">For a key management
       protocol, the property that compromise of long-term keys does not
       compromise session/traffic/content keys that are derived from or
       distributed using the long-term keys.  </t>

       <t hangText="Man-in-the-Middle attack (MiTM):">A form of active
       wiretapping attack in which an attacker intercepts and may
       selectively modify communicated data to masquerade as one of the
       entities involved in a communication.  Masquerading enables the
       MiTM to violate the confidentiality and/or the integrity of
       communicated data passing through it.  </t>

       <t hangText="Trust on First Use (TOFU):">In a protocol, TOFU
       typically consists of accepting an asserted identity, without
       authenticating that assertion, and caching a key or credential
       associated with the identity.  Subsequent communication using the
       cached key/credential is secure against a MiTM attack, if such an
       attack did not succeed during the (vulnerable) initial
       communication or if the MiTM is not present for all subsequent
       communications.  The SSH protocol makes use of TOFU. The phrase
       "leap of faith" (LoF) is sometimes used as a synonym.</t>

       <t hangText="Unauthenticated Encryption:">Encryption using a key
       management technique that enables unauthenticated communication
       between parties. The communication may be 1-way or 2-way
       unauthenticated.  If 1-way, the initiator (client) or the target
       (server) may be anonymous.</t>

  <section title="Opportunistic Security Design Philosophy">

   <t>
    <list style="hanging">

     <t hangText="Interoperate to maximize deployment:"> The primary
     goal of designs that feature opportunistic security is to be
     able to communicate with any correctly configured peer.  If a
     non-negligible number of potential peers are only capable of
     cleartext, then it is acceptable
     to fall back to cleartext when encryption is not possible.  If
     authentication is only possible for some peers, then it is
     acceptable to authenticate only those peers and not the rest.
     Interoperability must be possible without a prior need for the
     administrators of communicating systems to coordinate security
     policy.  Applications employing opportunistic security need
     to be deployable at Internet scale, with each peer independently
     configured to meet its own security needs (within the practical
     bounds of the employed protocol).  Opportunistic security
     must not get in the way of the peers communicating if neither
     end is misconfigured (i.e., neither publishes or negotiates
     security services that are not available or don't function
     correctly).  </t>

     <t hangText="Maximize security peer by peer:"> Subject to the
     above Internet-scale interoperability goal, opportunistic
     security strives to maximize security based on the capabilities
     of the peers.  For some opportunistic security
     protocols the maximal protection possible may be just
     unauthenticated encryption to address passive monitoring.  For
     others, protection against active attacks may be an option.
     Opportunistic security protocols may, when applicable, refuse to communicate
     with peers for which higher security is expected, but for some
     reason not achieved.  The conditions under which connections
     fail should generally be limited to operational errors at one
     or the other peer or an active attack, so that well-maintained
     systems rarely encounter problems in normal use of opportunistic
     security.  </t>

     <t hangText="Encrypt by default:"> An opportunistic security
     protocol MUST interoperably achieve at least unauthenticated
     encryption between peer systems that don't explicitly disable
     this capability.  To facilitate incremental deployment,
     opportunistic security protocols may tolerate cleartext connections
     or sessions with peers that don't support encryption.  Over
     time, as peer software is updated to support opportunistic
     security, only legacy systems or a minority of systems where
     encryption is disabled should be communicating in cleartext.
     Whenever possible, opportunistic security should employ Perfect
     Forward Secrecy (PFS) to make recovery of previously sent keys
     and plaintext computationally expensive even after disclosure
     of long-term keys.  </t>

     <t hangText="No misrepresentation of security:"> Unauthenticated
     communication or use of authentication that is vulnerable to
     MiTM attacks is not represented as strong security.  Where
     protection against active attacks is required, unauthenticated
     opportunistic security is not a substitute.  </t>
    </list>
   </t>

   <t>
     In summary, opportunistic security is an umbrella term that
     encompasses protocol designs that remove barriers to the
     widespread use of encryption on the Internet.  The actual
     protection provided by opportunistic security depends on the
     capabilities of the communicating peers.  Opportunistic security
     MUST at least aim to encrypt network traffic, while allowing
     fallback to cleartext with peers that do not appear to be
     encryption capable.
   </t>

   <t>
     It is important to note that opportunistic security is not
     limited to unauthenticated encryption.  When possible,
     opportunistic security SHOULD provide stronger security on a
     peer-by-peer basis.  For example, some peers may be authenticated
     via DANE, TOFU or other means.  Though authentication failure
     MAY be a reason to abort a connection to a peer that is expected
     to be authenticated, it MUST NOT then lead to communication
     in cleartext when encryption is an option.  Some Message
     Transfer Agents (MTAs, <xref target="RFC5598"/> Section 4.3.2)
     employing STARTTLS (<xref target="RFC3207"/>) have been observed
     to abort TLS (<xref target="RFC5246"/>) transmission when the
     receiving MTA fails authentication, only to immediately deliver
     the same message over a cleartext connection.  This design
     blunder MUST be avoided.
   </t>

  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sec_security">

    <t>
      Though opportunistic security potentially supports transmission in
      cleartext, unauthenticated encryption, or other protection levels
      short of the strongest potentially applicable, the effective
      security for users is increased, not reduced.  Provided strong
      security is not required by policy or securely negotiated, nothing
      is lost by allowing weaker protection levels, indeed opportunistic
      security is strictly stronger than the alternative of providing no
      security services when maximal security is not applicable.
